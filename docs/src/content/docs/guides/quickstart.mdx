This is a quick example that shows how to fit a Foster network model to thermal impedance data from a spreadsheet.

First, we need to import the necessary packages and load the data. The `thermal-network` package does not include `openpyxl` as a dependency. To run this example, you will need to install it: `pip install openpyxl`.

<Steps>

1.  **Load data from the spreadsheet**

    The excel file should be in the same folder as the script

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from openpyxl import load_workbook, workbook
    from thermal_network.fitting import fit_optimal_foster_network, trim_steady_state
    from thermal_network.conversions import foster_to_cauer

    # Load data from the spreadsheet
    workbook = load_workbook('excel_example.xlsx', read_only=True, data_only=True)
    worksheet = workbook["Thermal Data"]

    # Load time data
    cells = worksheet["C6:C103"]
    time_data = np.array([row[0].value for row in cells])

    # Load temperature data
    cells = worksheet["E6:E103"]
    impedance_data = np.array([row[0].value for row in cells])
    ```

2.  **Trim steady-state data points**

    The raw data may contain many data points at the end of the curve that are already in steady-state. These points can be removed to avoid overweighting steady-state in the loss
    function of the optimization algorithm (steady-state is enforced exactly by reparametrization).

    ```python
    time_data, impedance_data = trim_steady_state(
        time_data=time_data,
        impedance_data=impedance_data
    )
    ```

3.  **Fit a model to the data**

    We specify that the optimal model can have at most 10 layers

    ```python
    model = fit_optimal_foster_network(
        time_data=time_data,
        impedance_data=impedance_data,
        max_layers=10,
        tau_floor= 1e-3
    )
    ```

4.  **Convert the resulting Foster network to the Cauer topology**

    ```python
    best_model = model.best_model
    foster_network = best_model.network
    cauer_network = foster_to_cauer(foster_network)

    print("Fit completed!")
    print(f"Convergence was successful: {best_model.convergence_info['converged']}")
    print(f"Final Loss (MSE): {best_model.final_loss:.6f}")
    print("\nFitted Foster Network Parameters:")
    print(foster_network)
    print("\nEquivalent Cauer Network Parameters:")
    print(cauer_network)
    ```

</Steps>

The `fit_optimal_foster_network` function returns the best Foster network model found. We can then convert it to a Cauer network using the `foster_to_cauer` function.
